# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app I chose to design is a warehouse inventory application.
The requirements of the apps are:
1. Allow to log in.
2. View, add, edit, and remove the product in the warehouse.
3. Allow users to subscribe to the SMS messaging so that they can send an automated message when inventory is low.
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To meet the requirements of an app, it required four screens. Login page, product view page, product edit page, and notification page. To make it user-centric I used a similar theme throughout the whole app and an easy-to-follow page layout that transitions from one page to another with a simple push of a button.
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I simply approached by understanding the app requirements. I tried to keep it simple by only incorporating what the app asked for.
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
To ensure the code is functional I tested it with Android in built emulator.
# Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
This was an interesting project, however, it was not as simple as I had thought when going through the zyBooks lesson. I had to go back and forth re-studying the lessons and some YouTube videos to help me overcome a challenge.
# In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I enjoyed creating the UI for the app. However, making those UI work was a different task.
